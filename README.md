## Formulas Used

🔢 Here are some of the Excel formulas used to calculate metrics and create visualizations:

```excel
=COUNTIF(range, criteria)  // Count occurrences based on a condition
=AVERAGE(range)            // Calculate the average of a range
=SUM(range)                // Sum values in a range
=MONTH(date)               // Extract the month from a date
```
